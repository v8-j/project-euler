// The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the
// digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.
// There are thirteen such primes below 100: 
// 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.
// How many circular primes are there below one million?

// This is kind of similar to that lexicographic permutations problem, which I
// wasn't able to solve the reordering of digits problem. So I guess I'll come
// back to it later...
